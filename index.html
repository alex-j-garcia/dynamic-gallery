              <h1>Create a branch</h1>
              <p>
                When you're working on a project, you're going to have a bunch
                of different features or ideas in progress at any given time -
                some of which are ready to go, and others which are not.
                Branching exists to help you manage this workflow.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you create a branch in your project, you're creating an
                environment where you can try out new ideas. Changes you make
                on a branch don't affect the <code>main</code> branch, so
                you're free to experiment and commit changes, safe in the
                knowledge that your branch won't be merged until it's ready to
                be reviewed by someone you're collaborating with.
              </p>
              <h2>Pro Tip</h2>
              <p>
                Branching is a core concept in Git, and the entire GitHub flow
                is based upon it. There's only one rule: anything in the
                <code>main</code> branch is always deployable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because of this, it's extremely important that your new branch
                is created off of main when working on a feature or a fix. Your
                branch name should be descriptive (e.g.,
                <code>refactor-authentication</code>,
                <code>user-content-cache-key</code>,
                <code>make-retina-avatars</code>), so that others can see what
                is being worked on.
              </p>
            </article>
            <article class="gallery-article" data-content="commits">
              <h1>Add commits</h1>
              <p>
                Once your branch has been created, it's time to start making
                changes. Whenever you add, edit, or delete a file, you're
                making a commit, and adding them to your branch. This process
                of adding commits keeps track of your progress as you work on a
                fature branch.
              </p>
              <p>
                Commits also create a transparent history of your work that
                others can follow to understand what you've done and why. Each
                commit has an associated commit message, which is a description
                expalining why a particular chage was made. Furthermore, each
                commit is considered a separate unit of change. This lets you
                roll back changes if a bug is found, or if you decide to head
                in a different direction.
              </p>
              <h2>ProTip</h2>
              <p>
                Commit messages are important, especially since Git tracks your
                changes and then displays them as commits once they're
                published to the server. By writing clear commit messages, you
                can make it easier for other people to follow along and provide
                feedback.

              <h1>Open a Pull Request</h1>
              <p>
                Pull Requests initiate discussion about your commits. Because
                they're tightly integrated with the underlying Git repository,
                anyone can see exactly what changes would be merged if they
                accept your request.

                You can open a Pull Request at any point during the development
                process: when you have little or no code but want to share some
                screenshots or general ideas, when you're stuck and need help
                or advice, or when you're ready for someone to review your
                work. By using GitHub's @mention system in your Pull Request
                message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or
                teams, whether they're down the hall or ten time zones away.
              </p>
              <h2>ProTip</h2>
              <p>
                Pull Requests are useful for contributing to open source
                projects and for managing changes to shared repositories. If
                you're using a Fork & Pull Model, Pull Request provide a way to
                notify project maintainers about the changes you'd like them to
                consider. If you're using a Shared Repository Model, Pull
                Requests help start code review and conversation about proposed
                changes before they're merged into the main branch.
              </p>
            </article>
            <article class="gallery-article" data-content="discuss">
              <h1>Discuss and review your code</h1>
              <p>
                Once a Pull Request has been opened, the person or team
                reviewing your changes may have questions or comments. Perhaps
                the coding style doesn't match project guidelines, the change
                is missing unit tests, or maybe everything looks great and
                props are in order. Pull Requests are designed to encourage and
                capture this type of conversation.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can also continue to push to your branch in light of
                discussion and feedback about your commits. If someone comments
                that you forgot to do something or if there is a bug in the
                code, you can fix it in your branch and push up the change.
                GitHub will show your new commits and any additional feedback
                you may receive in the unified Pull Request view.
              </p>
              <h2>ProTip</h2>
              <p>
                Pull Request comments are written in Markdown, so you can embed
                images and emoji, use pre-formatted text blocks, and other
                lightweight formatting.
              </p>

            <article class="gallery-article" data-content="deploy">
              <h1>Deploy</h1>
              <p>
                With GitHub, you can deploy from a branch for final testing
                in production before merging to main.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once your pull request has been reviewed and the branch passes
                you tests, you can deploy your changes to verify them in
                production. If your branch causes issues, you can roll it back
                by deploying the existing main branch into production.
              </p>
              <p>
                Different teams may have different deployment strategies. For
                some, it may be best to deploy to a specially provisioned
                testing environment. For others, deploying to production may be
                the better choice based on the other elements in their
                workflow.
              </p>
            </article>
            <article class="gallery-article" data-content="merge">
              <h1>Merge</h1>
              <p>
                Now that your changes have been verified in production, it is
                time to merge your code into the main branch.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once merged, Pull Request preserve a record of the historical
                changes to your code. Because they're searchable, they let
                anyone go back in time to understand why and how a decision was
                made.
              </p>
              <h2>ProTip</h2>
              <p>
                By incorporating certain keywords into the text of your Pull
                Request, you can associate issues with code. When your Pull
                Request is merged, the related issues are also closed. For
                example entering the phrase <code>Closes #32</code> would close
                issue number 32 in the repository. For more information, check
                out our help article.
